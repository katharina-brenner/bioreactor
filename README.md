# Bioreactor Technical Analysis (BioTA)
Technical analysis workflow development for yield prediction and optimisation in bioreactors for cultivated meat production.
The motivation is to build on existing approaches by extending the modelling complexity to include time dependent behaviour and
to couple with detailed computational fluid dynamic models. The goal is to provide an openly accessible workflow that facilites yield 
prediction and bioreactor performance and cell metabolism based optimisation.

This work has been funded by the Good Food Institute (https.gfi.org) through their 2022 RFP.

## Usage
Clone to a working directory or to a location in your python path. Future releases may be provided as pip packages.

## Release History

### v0.1.0 Initial release 
Uses existing published modelling approaches for biorector performance and cell metabolism.
Examples for basic use of yield prediction and brute force optimisation.
